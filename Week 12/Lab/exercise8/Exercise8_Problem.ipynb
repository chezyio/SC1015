    "This notebook introduces you to **AI in Game Playing**. You will learn how to use an AI algorithm to make smarter moves in a game. The setup will be simple Tic-Tac-Toe (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe), and the objective of this notebook will be to create a Human vs Computer game with the Computer Player employing an AI strategy for gameplay. Some of the code is provided, while you may have filled in some on your own. Give it a shot, and have fun!        \n",
